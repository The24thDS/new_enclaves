  neshr.901.desc: "After destroying the ancient Shroud's Children station in [ne_shroud_system.GetName] system, our capable forces combed the area it once occupied for anything valuable. They managed to recover several memory fragments from the Shroud's Children databanks that should be a great boon to our research."
  neshr.902.a.desc: "$neshr.902.ab.desc.start$\n\nResidual ion trails suggest that forces from the [ne_shroud_destroyer.GetName] were behind this attack."
  neshr.902.b.desc: "$neshr.902.ab.desc.start$\n\nThe forces responsible for this attack remain unidentified."
  neshr.902.ab.desc.start: "Deep space communication arrays picked up a brief automated distress call from the Shroud's Children station in the [ne_shroud_system.GetName] system. The transmission ceased after just a few minutes, and long-range recon probes have confirmed that the ancient space station has been destroyed."
  neshr.902.c.desc: "$neshr.902.cd.desc.start$ by forces loyal to the [ne_shroud_destroyer.GetName]. Unfortunately, this also means that we have lost all access to the valuable services of the Prime Machines."
  neshr.902.d.desc: "$neshr.902.cd.desc.start$ by unknown forces. Unfortunately, this also means that we have lost all access to the valuable services of the Shroud's Children."
  neshr.902.cd.desc.start: "All contact has been lost with the [From.GetName], and our recon assets have confirmed that the ancient Shroud's Children station was destroyed"

  neshr.902.b: "This has cost us dearly!"
  neshr.904.desc: "It has come to our attention that some members of our order have been martyred by your hands. We sincerely thank you for conceding us this honor.\n\nNotwithstanding, we are obliged to interrupt any prior arrangements or accords we had in place. Suicide is a quite different thing from martyrdom, even though they may have similar results."
  neshr.904.a: "End communications."
  neshr.905a.desc: "We are ready to return to the Shroud. Are you ready to sustain its wrath?"
  neshr.905b.desc: "We are sad you couldn't accept our truths, fellow creature."
  neshr.905c.desc: "Physical reality is but an illusion. Have you come to free us from it?"
  neshr.905d.desc: "Your violent nature is just another result of your attachment to the material realm."
