  neshr.901.desc: "After destroying the ancient Shroud's Children station in [ne_shroud_system.GetName] system, our capable forces combed the area it once occupied for anything valuable. They managed to recover several memory fragments from the Shroud's Children databanks that should be a great boon to our research."
  neshr.902.a.desc: "$neshr.902.ab.desc.start$\n\nResidual ion trails suggest that forces from the [ne_shroud_destroyer.GetName] were behind this attack."

  neshr.902.ab.desc.start: "Deep space communication arrays picked up a brief automated distress call from the Shroud's Children station in the [ne_shroud_system.GetName] system. The transmission ceased after just a few minutes, and long-range recon probes have confirmed that the ancient space station has been destroyed."

  neshr.904.desc: "It has come to our attention that some members of our order have been martyred by your hands. We sincerely thank you for conceding us this honor.\n\nNotwithstanding, we are obliged to interrupt any prior arrangements or accords we had in place. Suicide is a quite different thing from martyrdom, even though they may have similar results."
