I've decided to fork his repo and maintain the mod since he has been inactive for the last 16 months.
Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

Here is his description of the mod:

This mod adds 3 new enclaves to the game. They are:

- **The Universal Hive (Hive Enclave)**
  - Hire to increase Society Research by 10% for 10 years
  - (+50 opinion) Hire to increase stability by 5 points for 10 years
  - (+50 opinion, must be hive) Hire a special governor with the Universal Drone trait (-50 deviance)
- **The Prime Machines**
  - Hire to increase Engineering Research by 10% for 10 years
  - (+50 opinion) Hire a special governor with the Prime Machine trait (increases robotic pop output by 10%)
  - (+80 opinion) Buy a new trait for your robots: Sapient Machine (4 trait points, +10% output)
  - (100 opinion) Trade 20/40/60 monthly Energy for 1/2/3 Living Metal
- **The Shroud's Children**
  - Hire to increase Physics Research by 10% for 10 years
  - (+30 opinion) Hire to increase Spiritual Attraction by 50% for 10 years
  - (+50 opinion) Hire a special governor with the Saint trait (+20% unity production)
  - (100 opinion) Trade 20/40/60 monthly Energy for 1/2/3 Zro

These additions are probably not very balanced, but I think they are cool and add some flavor to the game... hopefully.

Of course, if they prove to be too broken, I will change they based on the feedback received. So if you have any suggestions, I'm all ears!

# COMPATIBILITY

_No vanilla files overwritten._

Although the mod won't break ongoing saves, the new enclaves require a new game to spawn.

# TRANSLATION

If you want to contribute by translating the locs, you can do that on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/new-enclaves). Once you login/register and request access to one of the languages I will grant you access to start translating it. The translations in the repo are updated every 24 hours with the new ones from Crowdin.
